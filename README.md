# Security Dashboard

**NOTE: initial commit. *Don't expect too much!***

**Motivation**

Having reviewed a fair number of ISO standards, it was time to look online at some actual tooling. It turns out there are some incredibly interesting, useful *(and some, scary)* tools out there! Given that we're designing a dashboard anyway, why not just throw a mock-up together? As such, this mini project *(for the time being)* intends to mimic an actual solution, drawing from existing cybersecurity products.

## TODO: 
  
* ~~setup vite for bundling~~
* ~~add useful resources to repo~~
* ~~add .gitignore~~
* wireframes
* grab boilerplate from [flowbite](https://flowbite.com/blocks/)
* translate/implement wireframes for dashboard
* consider other pages:
  * Audit Logs
  * Policies
  * SIEM
  * Add a seperate page for references on the front-end
* fix README.md
* Review additional ISO standards
* Revise Dashboard

## Useful links, resources and references: 

*ahem, I'm not totally sure these belong here, but they're resources that I thought may be of useful to refer back to (and I have far too many browser tabs open), so I'm dropping them here! Maybe someone else will find something useful!*
